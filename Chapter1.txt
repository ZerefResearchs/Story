All Life Is Temporary, All Thing Great and Small Die.
The Things We Carry Should Life Us Up, Not Weigh Us Down. Memories, Love And Hope, Are The Lightest Neccessities.
Honor Is In The Heart, Not The Name.
You Cannot Know Strength Until You're Broken.
It's Not How Much Time You Have, It's How You Use It.
Everyone Wears A Mask, I Just Chose To Create My Own.
You Do Not Know Burden, Until You've Seen A Thousand People Hanging On Your Every Word.
Pressing Forward Is Not The Same As Running From Your Mistakes.
Sometimes Silence Is Loud.
I Find The Stranger The Life Gets, The More It Seems To Make Sense.
We Will Show Them, We Will Show Them All.
What could've been.
Enemy
